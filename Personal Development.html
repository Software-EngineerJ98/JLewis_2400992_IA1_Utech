        <h3>4. Achieve Your Goals</h3>
        <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Goals give our lives direction and meaning. They should be clearly written but also broken into short-term, medium-	term and long-term plans. The process of pursuing these goals shapes the kind of person you will become.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This chapter taught me that success is not only about reaching reaching a goal but about who I become through the 	discipline, focus, and effort it takes to reach said goal. I now make a habit of writing my goals and monitoring my progress so my growth stays 	intentional.</p>

      <article id="pillar-5" class="pillar">
        <h3>5. The Proper Use of Time</h3>
        <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Time is not only life’s most valuable asset but also the most valuable asset we humans possess. The way we schedule 	our days determines our future. Successful people spend their time on what is most important, not just what appears to be most urgent.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I often realized how much time I lost to distractions.This pillar reminded me to schedule my day around priorities 	such as study, health, and relationships. Effective time management brings balance and reduces stress.</p>

        <h3>6. Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
        <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Our closest friends influence our attitudes, habits, and by extension our results. To grow, we must choose our 	friends, mentors, and teammates wisely. These should be people who inspire and challenge us to become better daily.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> After reading this, I became more aware of how my friend groups can affect my mindset. I now try to network with 	positive, motivated individuals who share similar values and mindsets but also encourage self-improvement.</p>

        <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Continuous learning keeps our minds  sharp and adaptable.Reading, observing, and applying new knowledge helps us to 	stay ahead in an ever changing world such as this.</p>
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This chapter inspired me to make learning a daily habit, whether through books, podcasts, or experiences. It 	reminded me that education does not stop after you exit school and that personal growth is a lifelong journey.</p>
