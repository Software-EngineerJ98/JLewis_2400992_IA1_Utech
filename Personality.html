    <h2>My Top 3 Personality Traits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tenacity</strong> – I tend to do things as closely as possible to a given example as possible. This impacts my academic life by allowing me to be better equipped to handle the subjects that I perceive to be harder.</li>
      <li><strong>Attention to Detail</strong> – Along with my tenacity comes my attention to detail. This trait aids me well, especially in the field of computer science where a semi-colon can be the difference between a working program and a program that has an error and with this example attention to detail can also be seen in my academics as it increases the accuracy in work.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration and Communication</strong> – My strong collaboration and communication complete my top 3 traits as they enable me to perform efficiently in a collaborative capacity which is what most organizations including universities require.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Hero</h2>
    <img src="./Assets/steve_jobs.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs">
    <p>My hero is <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>. He inspires me because his company (Apple) was started by him and his partners selling personal belongings in order to raise capital to build their first line of apple products. Steve Jobs is my hero because based on how he started his company and his quote which I have outlined, it taught me that you can start from the lowest point in your life and still become something big.</p>
